This trip to Art Basel was to witness art history unfold. It was my first time in Qatar and I was gifted with many unexpected memories that I gratefully hug to my bosom. 

During my second evening in Doha, I had to order a 6-seater Uber, 3 times, to transport my mobility scooter to all the museum events. The BMWs get scarce during peak hours (not that they could carry my scooter anyway) and the First Choice queues would build up. Every VIP is headed to the same events, we all shared a unanimous schedule. To ease my carbon footprints, I offered my extra seats to anybody waiting in line. 

The first ride was to see Rikrit’s work in the park; the second ride was to attend Wael’s VIP dinner at the spectacular old fire station project; and the third ride was to return to the fair grounds near midnight. In all three car rides, I was stirred by conversations with remarkable people - one or two, I suspect are clearly handpicked by God for lifetime friendship. Though it wouldn’t be the only time my mind got blown in Doha, this particular story is about uncanny alignments that zapped me with yet another cat encounter.

Upon arrival at the first location, I spent part of an hour getting lost along the MIA Park with my fellow passengers - a Korean curator and her Lebanese artist partner. At first I was not super happy about being late and wondered where my night was leading - then cats started to appear from out of the manicured bushes like secret agents. One by one, they behaved like ushers. Each cat would accompany me for about 20 meters or so, exchanging casual meows and smile blinks, then another agent would catch up and take over the delegation. 

Nothing overly uncommon for me, I have gotten used to this level of diplomacy whenever I land in cat territory.. but as I advanced along the way - by the time I got truly lost - there were 3 cats neatly spaced apart in equal distance like identical feline statues on the left side of my pathway. They were stationary like London guards, their positions were exactly the same, perfectly aligned with the floor tiles. These were real cats, with imperfect whiskers and nipped ears, not sculptures. What a rare moment to see street cats in synchronised postures. At this point, I realise “I’m certain there is a cat portal right here”. 

#CATSEVERYWHERE

I had been very impressed with my visit so far, having been in the audience of members from the royal family - hearing about their exacting efforts to advance the Qatari nation in the arts. They had formidably employed prominent curators to elevate their cultural ministry in a congruent manner. It looks unparalleled from my humble standpoint. The way Qatar had welcomed the art world to Doha was of an unprecedented level, but how did they organise the cats to behave this way?

Meantime I wondered if the cats were minding the “foreigners everywhere” in their park. 

When the cats stopped ushering me, I turned back and eventually found the Thai artist’s social installation. I didn’t stay long at that show - and escaped the mob once David Beckham arrived with the royals. 

As I absentmindedly ruminated about my latest cat encounters, Claire Fontaine’s “Foreigners Everywhere” lit up my hair follicles. I ordered my second Uber of the evening and offered a ride to a random couple who agreed to cancel their own Uber to join my car.

My new companions introduced themselves as Fulvia and James. They were attentive about my mobility matters, I was spontaneously charmed. How God had blessed me through my life challenges that always brings the most remarkable souls. 

Well, it was a good thing that we were in an Uber ride, when I learned that Fulvia and James is the Claire Fontaine duo in flesh, or I might have fallen off my wheelchair.

“How blessed I am to run into them this way!”

At this point, you can stop reading, but if you want back stories about my affiliation with cats - here it is.

I am a social movement artist but this type of work doesn’t earn me any money. Another project that I have been developing over my lifetime is a large scale installation titled “Pirate’s Daughter”.

In order for my world to sustain itself, I inevitably paint cats to pay rent. If you ever encounter a Rooftop Cat painting - 90% of the time it would be by me. 

In the early years, I very much minded the criticisms about my painting cats. I tried to stop but couldn’t. Those roofscapes come from my architectural fixation for repetitive brushstrokes that I borrowed from my Chinese calligraphy. Cats just won’t leave me alone either.

During small talk, people would naturally ask if I love cats and I would be agitated. 
“Uh. It is not just that.” 
Lots of people love cats and I promote that. Over and above the love, I have had an unusual journey with cats since before I developed cognitive memories - so I cannot explain why - I do not know (yet) how I got chosen. My encounters with cats does not feel regular. 

Naturally I draw cats very easily, I write music for cats, I design luxury homes for cats, I talk to cats, cats talk to me. All my cats end up behaving like attentive dogs for some reason. I get the extra facet from my cats somehow and I do not believe it is because they have a full-time butler.

My earliest memory was through 8 years old lens. I told a dusty white cat to wait for me to finish my Chinese calligraphy class and he sat for 3 hours outside the convenience store until I reappeared with my father. This cat sauntered into our home and never left. His main occupation thereafter was to rescue injured cats, drowning kittens and he would bring them home to feed them out of his own bowl. Through such miracles, I became a cat patron at a very young age. I grew up spinning cats like a DJ who lost her marbles to the floor.

One day I plan to manufacture sustainable cat litter because I want to change lives in cat ownership. Haha did I just say that out loud? No surprise that I also started a movement in cat comedy.

I have more encounters with cats than I could remember. The first short film I ever made is titled “The Rooftop Cat has 9 Lives”. 

When I painted my public piece, stray cats would come to watch me all night for the entire week. When I sing and play the piano, my cats would purr with their bellies up. When I go to a seaside holiday, a cat will walk me to my chalet and move in with me. When I stayed in my friend’s attic in Provence, her cat would break in through the window like a thief in the night. There were many rendezvous with rooftop cats before I started to paint them. 

I thought I would not be surprised by cats anymore but Doha was extraordinary. This feels like an unwarranted love affair threatening to pelt furry pink noses and pink paws at me.

For my last car ride, I had 4 people cram into my car and we vowed to meet each other again and again all over the art world. Each friendship opened a new tribe to me. Many. Cool. Curators. And. Cats Everywhere.
