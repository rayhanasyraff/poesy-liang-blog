This trip to Art Basel was to witness art history unfold. It was my first time in Qatar and I was gifted with many unexpected memories that I gratefully hug to my bosom.

During my second evening in Doha, I needed a 6‑seater Uber three times to move my mobility scooter between venues. BMWs were scarce at peak hours (and they couldn’t have carried the scooter anyway), and First Choice queues grew long as every VIP seemed to be on the same circuit. To reduce my carbon footprint I offered the extra seats to people waiting in line.

The first ride took me to Rikrit’s work in the park; the second to Wael’s VIP dinner at the converted fire station; and the third returned me to the fairgrounds near midnight. In all three journeys I was stirred by conversations with remarkable people—one or two of whom I suspect are handpicked by God for lifetime friendship. This story, however, is about a small uncanny alignment that resulted in another cat encounter.

At the first site I spent almost an hour wandering MIA Park with my fellow passengers—a Korean curator and her Lebanese artist partner. I was irritated at being late and wondering where the night might go when cats began to emerge from the manicured bushes as if sent on errands. One by one they escorted me, each trailed me for twenty metres or so with casual meows and blinked smiles, then handed the task to the next.

That level of feline diplomacy is not new to me, but by the time I was properly lost three cats appeared in perfect, evenly spaced positions on the left side of the path—stationary like London guards, aligned with the paving tiles. They were living creatures, imperfect whiskers and nicked ears and all, not sculptures. It felt like standing above a cat portal.

I had been impressed earlier by the country’s cultural ambition—members of the royal family in the audience, well‑resourced curatorial teams and an unprecedented welcome for the international art world. Still, I wondered how a place that executed things so precisely could also produce such spontaneous feline choreography.

When the cats stopped guiding me I backtracked and found a Thai artist’s social installation. I didn’t linger—David Beckham’s arrival with the royals sent the crowd into a different orbit.

Claire Fontaine’s “Foreigners Everywhere” kept buzzing in my head. I ordered my second Uber and invited a random couple to share the ride; they cancelled their own booking and climbed in.

They introduced themselves as Fulvia and James, and they were unexpectedly attentive about mobility logistics—kind, warm and charming in a way that made me feel blessed by the odd mercies life provides.

Well, it was fortunate we were in the same car: discovering Fulvia and James were the Claire Fontaine duo in person might have made me tumble out of my wheelchair.

“How blessed I am to run into them this way!”

If you’d like a backstory about my relation to cats, here it is.

I make social movement art that rarely pays the bills. To keep going I also paint cats—Rooftop Cat roofscapes that come from my obsession with architectural repetition and Chinese calligraphy; if you see one, there’s a high chance it’s mine.

Early on I fretted about the criticism; I tried to stop and couldn’t. Cats have always been part of my life. People ask if I love cats and I bristle—this is more than love. I can’t explain why, only that my encounters with cats stretch back before my earliest memories.

I draw cats effortlessly, compose music for them, design fanciful homes for them and, sometimes, have conversations that feel reciprocal. My cats behave with the attention of dogs, and I’ve often wondered whether some other intelligence accompanies them.

My clearest childhood memory is at eight: I told a dusty white cat to wait while I finished my Chinese calligraphy class; he sat outside the shop for three hours until I returned with my father. He moved into our home and stayed. Later he would rescue injured strays and bring them home to feed from his bowl—small miracles that made me a cat patron.

One day I want to make sustainable cat litter to change lives in ownership—did I just say that out loud? No wonder I also started a tiny cat‑comedy movement.

I’ve had too many feline encounters to list. The first short film I made was called “The Rooftop Cat has 9 Lives.” When I painted in public, stray cats watched all night; when I played piano, the cats curled and purred with their bellies up. On holiday a cat once walked me to my chalet and moved in. In Provence a friend’s cat broke through a window like a thief. These rendezvous with rooftop cats shaped me before I ever decided to paint them.

Doha still surprised me. It felt like an extravagant love affair that threatened to pelt me with furry pink noses and warm paws.

For my last ride four of us squeezed into the car and vowed to meet again across the art world. Each friendship opened a new tribe—many cool curators, and, yes, cats everywhere.
