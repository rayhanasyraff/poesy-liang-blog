Hello all!

Poesy 小詩 here. IG @poesyliang

I have been quiet and busy with life, but inevitably the urgency to create community for the arts in Malaysia has been biting me for years. So this is the major reason behind my old family home (also my first artist studio from 2006-2017) turning into The RTC.

### What is The RTC?
Now a hideout for artists, the old courtyard flat houses an international artist residency program and a meeting place for artistic collaborators. This location is entirely dedicated to the arts out of my own pocket. At any one point, there may be 1 to 3 artists who pay a nominal fee to experience residing in Kuala Lumpur at this unique location. I no longer live nor have my studio there, but it is still an official outpost of mine. There are 3 cheeky cats who are permanent residents at The RTC. Follow IG @rooftopcatkl @poesycatcircus

### Music for the public.
So we are organising another street concert. This time we will present a fresh line up of indie musicians. I have a feeling that a couple of maestros would also pop around with their gear.

### Note of gratitude.
I am ever so thankful to partner up with a team of young musicians who are hyper excited to create an unusual stage for an uncommon audience, made up of random street people of Imbi + you. God knows what a powerful blessing this is.

### About the location.
Jalan Horley is off the beaten tracks but yet in the heart of all the buzz. You will see. The RTC is just minutes from TRX station. Street parking is haphazard, there is an open carpark within walking distance. Heck! Lot10, Berjaya Times Square, Sungei Wang, Pavilion, TRX - all within walking distance.

### About the free concert.
This event is powered entirely by volunteers, everything is free. As for the #RestroomRibbons gimmick, there are many shops surrounding the location where you can buy a drink to use their toilet. Just that I do not expect any volunteers to wash toilets, hence this task is reserved for paid workers. So I am only charging for the use of toilet and making you donate towards my electricity bill, and I do not really mind if you don’t use my facility - that is why I charge RM9 to deal with your waste. Consider the money as your contribution to my housekeeping matters. Haha.

### To artists/creative practitioners.
If you are someone who has been in the arts for a number of years, do lend your presence to encourage the young.

### To my famous friends.
The bigger your name is, the larger your impact, while it should not matter how famous we get with our life's work. What is important is how you use that to lift others. It is a big deal if you would show up for the young ones.

### To everybody.
Be present to experience the diversity this street concert has to offer, maybe take home some lifelong friendships. I know you are guaranteed to leave with unique memories.

### To individuals who are not artists.
If you feel that you can add value to the crew, comment here to let me know how. Maybe there is a need, maybe there isn’t. Let’s see.

### To businesses.
For the last street concert, GWM contributed a sum to support The RTC and I allowed them to park a super cute Good Cat Ora next to the performance stage without any commercial credit (we are underground like that). If any of you business owners want to be part of this cause, your money will be used to give the musicians a cash token of appreciation like we did last year.

### To myself.
After the last street concert, many people who missed it vowed to come to the next one. Frankly I can hardly remember who attended and who I am meant to alert this time around. I try to tag people as they pop up in my mind.

### To you.
If you are excited reading this, please share this with 3 friends so we can cover most people in our 6 degrees of connections.

### To potential volunteers.
I need photographers, videographers, drone camera enthusiasts, and ushers. Or people who are hyperactive with their phone cameras and posts things nonstop on their IG stories. I do not need you to be an influencer/KOL. Come as you are.

Please apply by commenting here so a volunteer can catch it. I may or may not have the bandwidth to respond to private messages.

See you on FRI 11/21 from 8pm till late.
