summary: "From stray to big boss at 13, HarryPutter proves God did good"
---

#HarryPutter our big boss turned 13 and he now lives in his 3rd art production studio & residence whom we recently moved to.  This steady old guy first appeared in 2012 as a timid kitten and grew healthily into a ridiculously funny monkey (which incidentally saved Poesy 小詩 from suicide) and together they have journeyed through her lowest moments and greatest highlights of life.

Aside from being an amazing member of our family, #HarryPutter worked as an artist gallery cat, highly professional with his appearances and is a natural entertainer with our media friends and art VIPs alike.

Nowadays he is semi-retired and sleeps a lot, with 2 galleries and 3 art production houses in his abundant belly.

He loves his new home, especially the spotless marble floors and butler services.   This is a story of rags to riches, how God has used this humble stray cat to add to the journey of POESY 小詩 梁小詩 and her closest circles.

Loyalty pays off.

Happy Birthday HarryPutter 黑日白兔!

Go adopt a stray cat today and give it your best life.
